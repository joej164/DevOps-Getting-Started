# Intro to DevOps from a Network and Telephony Perspective

DevOps is the new hotness and/or buzzword in the Technology industry.  This document is a brief overview of what i've learned recently DevOps is and things a Network / Telephony / Infrastrucure engineer needs to know to stay relevent in the industry.

## What is DevOps?

Here's the Google Link to wikipedia.
[Wikipedia link to DevOps Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps)

It's the merging of Software Engineering and Infrastructure engineering into one team or group.

In a practical terms, the Infrastructure teams are going to be looking for Software Engineers to add to their teams rather than more Infrastructure Engineers.  Your skills will have less of a demand in the market place if they don't also include some Software Engineering Skills.

## What does this mean to you?
In the next 5 years i predict, all new Network / Telephony / Infrastructure gear will be progrogrammed primarially via API's.  

This means as an Infrastructure Engineer you need to learn new skills.

* What do Software Engineers do?
* What tools do they use?
* What is an API?
* How can I use it to make my box do stuff?

'Note: I didn't mention learning software languages.  I believe this will be useful, but not required at first'

## Why do I need to learn this?
I come from a Telecom background.  In the early 2000's when IP Telephony started happening, Telecom engineers who wanted to stay relevent had to learn new skills.  What's in IP address?  What a subnet?  The network engineer didn't care about this.  Nor did s/he have to.  They already had enough on their plate without having to learn about dial plans and hunt groups.  

It was painful at first, I had to get my CCNA, but once I did, it made working in the space much easier because I could speak their language and tell them what i wanted / needed.

The same shift is occuring with the move to the DevOps Model.  Software engineers don't care about Telephony Dial Plans or Subnets.  They care about API's, Collaboration Tools, Open Source and various other things that I'm not fully aware of at this point in time.


## Do I need to learn to become a programmer?
Yes and No.  The more you learn, the more useful you'll be.  But unless you find you're really passionate about what programming, you don't really need to.  You mostly need to know how to talk to the programmers and how to let them know what is needed.


## Where do I start?
**Start with [GitHub](http://www.github.com)**

* Create an account.  
* Learn how it works.
* Pull down this document onto a local repository and edit it.
  * At the end i'm going to have a visitor log, add your name to this document.
  * If you have some edits you'd like to make, go for it.  I'll review and commit if they make sense.

Use this document as a way to practice contributing to other peoples GitHub accounts.  Create your own.  

I'm creating this document as a way of understanding how GitHub works as well as a also helping spread my knowledge i've learned in the last several months.

**Learn [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)**

This is a tool for parsing REST API's.  I think you can also use it for SOAP API's also, but i've not investigated.  What's really cools is you can create code snipits for whatever language your Programmers want to use.  




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/joej164/DevOps-Getting-Started/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/joej164/DevOps-Getting-Started/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
